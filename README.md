# mnist-neural-net

Neural network that classifies images of handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset. No external neural net packages were used and all math/algorithms were implemented by hand.

Achieves approximately 97% training accuracy and 96% test accuracy.

Developed as part of a UC Berkeley machine learning course project.
